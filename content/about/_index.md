*The Social Futures Lab is based out of the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at University of Washington. We are reimagining social and collaborative systems to empower people and improve society.*

Our blog serves as a home for our reflections, ideas, and perspectives about all things social computing, HCI, collaborative technology, Human-AI Interaction, AI ethics! We also feature recommendations of media that inspire our work and hopefully inspire yours too!

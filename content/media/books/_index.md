  <strong>Review by Advait:</strong>  
 Conceptualises a third form of thinking/cognition – designerly thinking. This is separate from the goal of ‘science’ (seeks to understand natural phenomena through systematic investigation) and ‘humanities’ (interprets human experience through analysis); designers focus on creating artificial solutions to improve human situations. This sort of shows the 'is vs ought' distinction between sciences and design, where designers try to show ways how the world 'ought to be’. It also tried to get to a different form of ‘reasoning’ that designers do, which isn't necessarily inductive or deductive, it's kinda like abductive or retroductive. Also builds out an epistemology for designers that is a bit different from science or humanities.

  <strong>Review by Amy:</strong>  
  I really like this book but I also thought she doesn’t do a great job when she veers into HCI, somewhere in the latter half when she discusses designs for limiting phone usage, etc. but it’s not really a design book. It is inspiring/has lots of great history and art related discussion.

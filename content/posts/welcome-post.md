This is the first post on the SFL blog! ðŸŽ‰

We are excited to create this online space to share our ideas and work! Whether it's a reflection on today's technologies, summary of a recent research paper, interesting finds related to HCI & Social Computing, or creative pursuits, you will find it here.

Here are some goals for the blog: ðŸŒ±

- Encouraging the process of learning in public, sharing in-progress ideas, and making connections across topics
- Sharing thoughts about current discourses in HCI, HAI, Social Computing, etc.
- Sharing and announcing activities within our lab
- Sharing inspiration, random thoughts, or media that inspires our research
- Sharing interesting activities or creative pursuits outside of research
